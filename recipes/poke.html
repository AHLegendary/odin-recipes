        <h1>What is Poke?</h1>
        <p>In Hawaiian, the word poke means "to slice" or "to chop into pieces." 
            The cubed raw fish is what is meant by this phrase. 
            Its creators were Hawaiian fishermen who used to season the remains of their catch as a snack. 
            Although poke is a Hawaiian-American dish, many of its flavors—soy sauce, green onions, and sesame oil—come from Japanese cuisine.
        </p>
        <p>Any raw fish can be used to make poke, including raw salmon and octopus. 
            However ahi or yellowfin tuna is the most widely consumed seafood in poke. 
            This is sometimes referred to as <strong>tuna poke</strong> or <strong>ahi poke</strong>. Describe shoyu ahi poke. 
            Since the Japanese name for soy sauce is <em>shoyu</em>, shoyu ahi poke is simply poke that contains ahi tuna and soy sauce. 
            They all essentially refer to the same thing!

            <li>Slice the tuna into 1-inch cubes. Mince the onion. Thinly slice the green onions. 
                Mix them in a bowl with the soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic, ginger, kosher salt and Sriracha.
            </li>
            <li>Serve immediately, but for most authentic flavor marinate in refrigerator for 15 minutes to 1 hour. 
                Taste and add a sprinkle of salt before serving. 
                (Get this in the fridge while the rice boils and you prep the veggies, and you can eat when it's all done.)
